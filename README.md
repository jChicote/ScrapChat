# ScrapChat
This is a design prototype for the proposed app "SCRAPCHAT" being created for the the UTS Course: Advanced Interaction

# Note @Jaiden
A couple stuffs that needs to be changed on the Main.storyboard you're working on for the Login.storyboard to work:
* Delete the SignInViewController on the Main.storyboard. Using it on my new storyboard
* Name the StoryboardID part of the main menu screen to ViewController. If you rename this to something else, also change the VC reference on Model/Constants
* Set Login.storyboard as the initial VC
