#### 2. The project

This app was developed using xCode targetted towards tablet users and utilised common technologies and solutions used 
amongst people to serve as familiar tools in communication. 

The application contains peer-to-peer video chat as a core component of the features within the application. Video chat, utilised 
the Agora.io libraries to develop more customisable implementation of video communication where traditional facetime was constricted 
with its default requirements and implementation. This was so it can enable scrapbooking, whilst in video call. Enabling picture-in-picture 
functionality between video chat and scrap-bookinbng.
